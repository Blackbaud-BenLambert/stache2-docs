<h3>Scenarios</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When you were running <stache-code>skyux new --template stache</stache-code> or <stache-code>npm install</stache-code>, did the install time out?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are you having a problem serving your site locally?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did you update the dependencies in the <stache-code>package.json</stache-code> file?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>You may want to re-run <stache-code>npm install</stache-code>. Before you do that, we recommend you delete your entire <stache-code>node_modules</stache-code> folder. In the command line for the Stache site folder, enter <stache-code>npm cache clear</stache-code>. When that completes, enter <stache-code>npm install</stache-code>.</p>
