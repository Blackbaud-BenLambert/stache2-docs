  - optionally, can add custom css
- VSTS repos are accessible to anyone in RDO
- Open source projects can be housed in GitHub for even greater opportunity for contributions
- Stache is in-progress, for the benefit of us all. Which means we are here to adapt and add features that your content development experts (User Ed) and you, the community, request.

End result is with our documentation patterns and components coupled with SKY UX, you have the ability to create a well-designed documentation experience, consistent across RDO.

However, Stache isn't for early collaborative documentation or projects where a team is taking a lot of notes and working through a solution together.

When you need to:
- share knowledge, including code, across a wide group
- teach
- onboard
- raise awareness
- tooling help content
- optimize your content for an external audience

the time you invest in creating good documentation can result in less friction for your users learning and understanding. Enable efficient self-service so you can spend less time answering questions.
